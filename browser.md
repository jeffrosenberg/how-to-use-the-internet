# What is a web browser?

A web browser is a program on your computer that helps you to access the Internet. Some common web browsers include:

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/){:target="_blank"}
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/){:target="_blank"}
- [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/){:target="_blank"}
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge){:target="_blank"}

_(This site mostly focuses on Chrome, because it's the most common browser, and the one members of my family use the most.)_

A web browser _isn't_ "the Internet", it's a tool you use to _access_ the Internet. On the page [What is a website?](/how-the-internet-works/websites), I wrote:

> When you view a simple website, such as this one, you're really reading a file stored on a computer. Typically, these files are written in a language called **HTML**: **Hypertext Markup Language**. HTML is a language that describes the structure and content of a web page. 

A web browser is a tool that knows how to interpret read HTML and display it in a user-friendly way.

Because you need a web browser to access the Internet and read web pages, it's important to understand how to use your web browser. The most common web browser components you'll interact with include:

- The [address bar](/browser/address-bar)
- The [navigation buttons](/browser/navigation-buttons)
- [Tabs](/browser/tabs)
- [Bookmarks](/browser/bookmarks)
- [History](/browser/history)
- [Extensions](/browser/extensions)
