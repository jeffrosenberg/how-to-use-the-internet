# What is a web browser?

A web browser is a program on your computer that helps you to access the Internet. Some common web browsers include:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

A web browser _isn't_ "the Internet", it's a tool you use to _access_ the Internet.

Important browser components you need to understand include:

- The [address bar](/browser/address-bar)
- [Tabs](/browser/tabs)
- [Bookmarks](/browser/bookmarks)
- [Extensions](/browser/extensions)
