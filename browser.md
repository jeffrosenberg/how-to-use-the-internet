# What is a web browser?

A web browser is a program on your computer that helps you to access the Internet. Some common web browsers include:

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/){:target="_blank"}
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/){:target="_blank"}
- [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/){:target="_blank"}
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge){:target="_blank"}

A web browser _isn't_ "the Internet", it's a tool you use to _access_ the Internet. TODO: more!

Important browser components you need to understand include:

- The [address bar](/browser/address-bar)
- [Tabs](/browser/tabs)
- [Bookmarks](/browser/bookmarks)
- [Extensions](/browser/extensions)
