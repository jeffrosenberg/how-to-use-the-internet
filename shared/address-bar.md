The **address bar** shows you what URL you're currently visiting (remember the [lesson about URLs](/how-the-internet-works/urls)):

TODO: Includes don't work on a shared page, make these into straight HTML

{% include figure.html url="/images/address-bar.png" description="A browser with the address bar highlighted" %}

Whenever you [navigate](/navigation) to a new page, the address bar changes to show you the new URL.

Or, if you know the new URL you want to visit, you can navigate there by typing the URL directly into the address bar:

{% include figure.html url="/images/address-bar-type-url.png" description="Typing a new URL into the address bar" %}

Make sure you type any new URL into the address bar, *not* into a search field on a web page:

TODO: Edit or retake the image below, currently shows yahoo.com in the address bar.

{% include figure.html url="/images/address-bar-dont-type-in-search.png" description="Don't type a new URL into a search field" %}

TODO: Search vs directly visiting a site via the address bar.
