# How to Use the Internet!

This is a simple project that serves two purposes:

1. Provide a simple, illustrated explainer for to help with basic Internet literacy -- originally targeted at my Mom and my kids
2. Give me a chance to play around with Github Pages and Jekyll 

I don't know if anyone else will ever have occasion to notice this project, but contributions welcome :smile:
