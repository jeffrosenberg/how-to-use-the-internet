Welcome! You've reached a page on the Internet that's all about how to find other pages on the Internet.

My goal is not to just give instructions, but to explain how things work so you understand the *reason* behind the instructions. We'll talk about how the Internet works in enough detail that everyday activities make sense, but not in so much detail that it makes your head hurt.

This site is written to be useful for both adults and kids, so I've tried to use simple language wherever I can.

### Lessons
