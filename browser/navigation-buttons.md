As you navigate the Internet, each tab in your browser keeps track of the history of the pages you've visited. You can use the **navigation buttons** to travel backwards and forwards in that history, or to return to your home page.

From left to right, the navigation buttons are:

- **Back**: returns you to the previous page in your history.
- **Forward**: sends you to the next page in your history.
  - This will only be an option if you've previously moved backwards; otherwise it will be disabled.
- **Reload**: reloads the current page.
  - This might be useful if the page didn't load properly, or if you want to check for new content.
- **Home**: brings you to whatever page is defined as your home page.

One other tip: by clicking and holding on the back or forward button, you can see a list of recent pages and move back or forward across multiple pages, instead of one at a time.
