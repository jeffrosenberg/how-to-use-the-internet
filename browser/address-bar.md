# The Address Bar

The **address bar** shows you what URL you're currently visiting (remember the [lesson about URLs](TODO)):

{% include figure.html url="/images/address-bar.png" description="A browser with the address bar highlighted" %}

Whenever you [navigate](/navigation) to a new page, the address bar changes to show you the new URL.

Or, if you know the new URL you want to visit, you can navigate there by typing the URL directly into the address bar:

{% include figure.html url="/images/address-bar-type-url.png" description="Typing a new URL into the address bar" %}

Make sure you type any new URL into the address bar, *not* into a search field on a web page:

{% include figure.html url="/images/address-bar-dont-type-in-search.png" description="Don't type a new URL into a search field" %}
