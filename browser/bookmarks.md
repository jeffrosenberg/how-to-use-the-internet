# Bookmarks

A **bookmark** is a shortcut to a particular [URL](/how-the-internet-works/urls). If you have a site you visit frequently, you _could_ [type its URL into the address bar](/browser/address-bar) every time you want to visit it. But it's a lot faster to save a shortcut so you can visit it with a single click. Many people also use bookmarks to help them remember sites they might want to revisit some day.

A typical bookmark contains only two pieces of information: The name of the website, and its URL. The name is there to help you identify the bookmark -- when you see the name, you know where the bookmark will bring you. When you click on the bookmark, your browser will open the bookmark's URL.

You can edit the name to anything you like, but don't change the URL unless you know what you're doing. The URL is what makes the bookmark work, and your browser will go wherever the URL says.
