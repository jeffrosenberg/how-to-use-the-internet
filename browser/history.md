Your browser keeps a detailed history of every page you visit. This can help your browser to improve its performance, but you can also use it to find a website you visited but can't remember, or to retrieve a tab you closed accidentally.

To access your history in Chrome, click on the three-dot menu and select `History`. The first line in the history menu will bring you to the history page, which gives you access to your full browser history. Below that, you can see a list of tabs you've closed recently. If you ever need to reopen a recently-closed tab, open the history menu and select the tab to reopen it!

Inside the history page, you'll be presented with a view of your full browsing history, organized by date, along with a tool for searching your history. From there, click on a page to open it, or click the three-dot menu for more options, including removing the page from your history.
