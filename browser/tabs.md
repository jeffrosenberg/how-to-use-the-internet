# Tabs

At the top of your browser is the **tab bar**. Your browser can have multiple **tabs** open at a time, each of which displays a different web site.

{% include figure.html url="/images/tabs.png" description="A browser with three open tabs" caption="This browser window has three tabs open" %}

Want to visit another website without closing the one you're currently using? Just click the *new tab* button:

{% include figure.html url="/images/tabs-new-tab.png" description="A browser with three open tabs and the new tab button circled" %}

Done with one of your tabs? Click the *close tab* button:

{% include figure.html url="/images/tabs-close-tab.png" description="A browser with three open tabs and the close tab button circled" %}
