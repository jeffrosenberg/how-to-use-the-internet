The [address bar](/browser/address-bar) and [bookmarks](/browser/bookmarks) are features of your browser that make it easier to navigate directly to websites. We'll discuss those further in the section on [using your web browser](/browser); for now, all you need to know is that your web browser makes it easy for you to go directly to a particular web site.

If you know the [URL](/how-the-internet-works/urls) of a web site, you can navigate directly to it by entering it into your address bar:

{% include figure.html url="/images/address-bar.png" description="A browser with the address bar highlighted" %}

If you have sites you visit frequently, you can use bookmarks to save those sites and easily return to them:

{% include figure.html url="/images/bookmarks.png" description="A browser window with bookmarks displayed" %}

You can read more about each of these features in the section on [using your web browser](/browser).
