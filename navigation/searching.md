Often, you're not trying to visit a particular website, but looking for a particular bit of information -- the answer to a question, a recipe, a product to buy, etc. In those cases, the most common way to find what you're looking for is to use a **search engine**. Search engines use sophisticated techniques to build in *index* of the entire Web, which allows you to use simple phrases and keywords to find the information you're looking for. 

All search engines share a basic design in common: They start with a search box where you enter your search query. You can execute your search by clicking a button or pressing `enter`. After that, you're shown a list of results, each of which is a [link](/navigation/links) to a website that matches your search.

Common search engines include:

- [Google](https://www.google.com)
- [Bing](https://www.bing.com)
- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)

## Search queries

A **search query** is the phrase or set of keywords you enter into a search engine to perform your search. There are two common strategies you can use when preparing a search query:

1. Focusing on the most important keywords you want to find:
  - *dog training tips*
  - *theory special relativity*
2. Writing questions:
  - *how do I teach my dog tricks?*
  - *what is the theory of special relativity?*

There are also some advanced search techniques that are worth knowing:

- Find complete phrases (instead of individual words) by surrounding them in quotes:
  - *who said "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself"?*
- Limit your search results to a single site to search inside a website:
  - *barack obama site:nytimes.com*
- *Exclude* a word from your search results by using a minus-sign:
  - *barack -obama*
