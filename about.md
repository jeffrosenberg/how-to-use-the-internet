# About this site

Hi! My name is Jeff, and I created this site to help my family members with Internet literacy. But writing everything in a word processor didn't really appeal to me, so I decided to use the opportunity to test out some [simple website building tools](https://jekyllrb.com) and publish it in case it could be helpful to others.

### Help me improve this site!
