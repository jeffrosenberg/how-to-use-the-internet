Hi! My name is Jeff, and I created this site to help my family members with Internet literacy. I believe that a basic understanding of the fundamentals will make it easier and less stressful to navigate the Internet, and help to keep people safe online.

Writing my tutorial in a word processor and distributing it on paper didn't really appeal to me, so I decided to use the opportunity to test out some [simple website building tools](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} and publish it on the Internet in case it could be helpful to others.

## Help me improve this site!
